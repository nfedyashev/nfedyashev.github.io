cat some_script.rb | heroku run console --app=my-heroku-app --no-tty

One-Liner
The run console command will read input from stdin and pass it to the remote console session. Knowing this, you can run a simple Rails query:

BASH
echo "puts User.count" | heroku run console --app=my-heroku-app
The result will be displayed in the terminal, but youâ€™ll still be in the Heroku console session. One way to avoid that would be to force the session to end by tacking on an exit to your one-liner.

BASH
echo "puts User.count; exit" | heroku run console --app=my-heroku-app
